# MMM-DutchWeatherStatic
From the default weather module. But 100% for own requirements.

Therefore I have no documentation available. You can use the one of the weather modules for Magic Mirror. This module is adapted to my own needs and has barely any configurable parameters in it.

Later on I will try to see if I can add suggestions to the weather module of MM.
